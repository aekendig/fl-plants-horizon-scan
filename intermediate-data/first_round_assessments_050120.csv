However, it may still arrive in here as it is readily available online and the species is capable of long distance dispersal, primarily by water. As with arrival, the warm climate of Florida makes establishment less likely. But in general European alder is very good at rapidly establishing through prolific seed production and the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Once established, this species alters ecosystem structure by forming dense monocultures and changing soil chemistry, which could result in changes of local biodiversity. Alders are also known to hybridize readily. ",1. Global Invasive Species Database; http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/speciesname/Alnus+glutinosa  2.

In Slovenia, plant and butterflies diversity, was lower in plots with Canadian goldenrod, but diversity of hoverflies and most beetles increased.  4. There are around 100 species in the genus Solidago in North America and hybrids between congeners are known to occur in the wild.  5. This species invades poorly managed pasture and can be a considerable weed in forest nurseries and in perennial gardens and crops.  6. Horses have been poisoned by consuming large quantities of contaminated hay.  7. Canadian golden responds positively to fire, chemical treatment may only kill the aboveground growth, and rhizomes can remain viable for up to 100 years.  8. However, consistent mowing over years can sufficiently control infestations and attempts are underway to establish a biocontrol.","1,5-8.

Thymeleaf speedwell is already present in Alabama and Georgia and has multiple unintentional dispersal pathways, which could transport it to Florida. It is unclear how well suited this species is to the climate in Florida. But thymeleaf speedwell is good at establishing highly disturbed areas, due to its vegetative growth, prolific seed production, and persistent seed bank. Other plant species may be negatively impacted by Veronica serpyllifolia ssp. serpyllifolia forming dense mats, however this species is limited to anthropogenically disturbed areas and there is unlikely to impact natural communities and associated trophic levels.","1.

This species is also an ornamental plant that is available for sale to the public.  4. However, there are also multiple mentions on gardening sites about its invasion status.  5. Some ornamental cultivars do not produce seed and may have a lower invasion risk, but cultivars are often difficult to distinguish from the wild type leading to risk of unintentional introduction.","1.

Cytisus scoparius is tolerant to USDA Zones 5-8 and its current range in the U.S. extends along the majority of both coasts, indicating a likely tolerance to the climate of at least northern Florida.  2. Scotch broom establishes best in sunny, disturbed habitats such as urban parks, pastures, cultivated fields, wastelands, grasslands, and coastal strips.  3. This species can fix nitrogen, allowing for a wide tolerance to soil types.  4. A mature shrub can produce 1,200-63,000 seeds per year, with around 45-50% germinate success.  5. More than 65% of seeds remain dormant for some period, and seed usually remain viable to 3-20 years but have germinated after up to 80 years.  6. Cytisus scoparius self-sows freely.  7. Scotch broom can reproduce by seed and vegetatively.  8. This species is potentially allelopathic and can leave a legacy affect in invaded soils even after it's removed.  9. This species readily resprouts after fire and can tolerate drought.  10. In the U.S., Scotch broom is listed as a noxious weed in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.  11. Cytisus scoparius is considered an invasive species and serious weed particularly in temperate natural areas and forestry production systems of the U.S., Canada, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, India, Iran, Japan, and South Africa.","1,10.

Cytisus scoparius forms large stands primarily through self-seeding, leading to shading and out-competing of native plants in natural and production systems.  2. Scotch broom is capable of fixing nitrogen and has some allelopathic potential, resulting in changes in nutrient cycling and legacy effects in invaded soils even after it is removed.  3. This species prevents the regeneration of natural forests and prairies.  4. This species also increases the risk of fire and readily resprouts after burning.  5. At least 5 threatened or endangered species are at higher risk because of Scotch broom.  6. In Brazil, this species is a threat to native species in the Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forest Ecoregion, which is a similar ecoregion to that found in the southeastern U.S..  7. Cytisus scoparius frequently hybridizes with native genotypes, introducing more vigorous growth and invasive traits.  8. Establishment of this species encourages other exotic species such as feral animals and birds.  9. Scotch brooms is a significant weed of forestry, particularly pine and eucalypt plantations around the world, as it smothers planted saplings or reduced their growth.  10. Plants are slightly toxic and unpalatable for browsing animals, degrading forage sites or fields.  11. Some plantations use this species as a beneficial nurse crop, but these introductions are often associated with higher levels of plantation disease from pests associated with Scotch broom.  12. In western North America, negative impacts of this species are estimated to have cost more than $11 million.  13. This species is also found in National Parks and other popular conservation sites, which is likely to have a negative effect on aesthetic value and therein tourism.  14. Integrated control methods repeated over many seasons is the most effective means of control; though several herbicides effectively control smaller infestations and biological controls have been considered.","1-5,8-9,11,13-14.

However, this species is still commercial available and there are multiple unintentional pathways of introduction for this species. Cytisus scoparius establishes quickly and prolifically through high seed production, vegetative growth, formation of dense clumps, a very long lived seed bank, nitrogen fixation, and tolerance to a wide range of ecosystem and soil types.

New Zealand Plant Conservation Network; https://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora/species/juncus-articulatus/",36,Low,"Juncus articulatus is a weedy, submerged or floating aquatic species. Jointleaf rush is native to much of the U.S. outside of the southeast, and the species does not have intentional long distance dispersal mechanisms. However, this species can be accidentally spread as a stowaway on people and equipment, or naturally dispersed by water or wind. In open, disturbed wetland areas, this species has high seed production, forms mats through vegetative growth, and can be a strong competitor against native species. There are also some sources that claim this species is spread as a seed contaminant and that it can clog waterways at high enough abundances. However, there was limited information about these impacts, and the overall habitat requirements of the species appear limiting to its distribution.",1.

This species is a good supplier of nectar and is pollinated by bees, moths, and butterflies.  4. Carduus crispus is capable of forming a seed bank.  5. This species prefers moist soils and can tolerate drought.  6. In the United States, this species is an invasive over limited areas in WV, prohibited noxious weed seed in MD, a minor weed in OR, and all species of the genus Carduus are noxious weeds in Arkansas and Iowa.  7.
