Economic: Control can be labour intensive as invasions advance and displace native plants. When flowering, Ligastrum spp. compete for bees; extensive infestations may reduce pollination of other crops like kiwifruit or honey production, as privet honey is not valued by beekeepers because it has a strong smell, and is too sweet.

In several US states and Canadian provinces, F. alnus is listed as a restricted noxious weed and it is prohibited to import, sell and transport it or its propagating parts. Since January 2002, the USA requires seeds of all species to have phytosanitary certificates, so this has limited importation from overseas suppliers. Suitable for hardiness zones 2a-8b.

However, considerable time and expense have been invested to remove the shrub from native habitats. F. alnus forms dense, even-aged stands and causes habitat degradation by shading out rare species and causing a decline in native species diversity (Taft and Solecki, 1990). Apart from a significant reduction in density and diversity of plant species in sites where F. alnus has become established, it may influence insect populations by changing food availability.

This species is a good supplier of nectar and is pollinated by bees, moths, and butterflies.  4. Carduus crispus is capable of forming a seed bank.  5. This species prefers moist soils and can tolerate drought.  6. In the United States, this species is an invasive over limited areas in WV, prohibited noxious weed seed in MD, a minor weed in OR, and all species of the genus Carduus are noxious weeds in Arkansas and Iowa.  7.
